This is a **Personal Web CV** project created to showcase my Curriculum Vitae in an interactive and responsive manner. The website provides an overview of my work experience, education, skills, and the projects I have worked on. The goal is to offer a more dynamic and engaging way to introduce myself in the professional world through an online portfolio.
